#####Borve is a traditional crofting village in West Harris

**The Croft House** is a comfortable modernised island cottage with 2 bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, bathroom and a porch. It has a large sunny west facing garden with a bench to sit and enjoy the views. The cottage is fully furnished and has a multi-fuel burning stove, shower, fully kitted kitchen and comfortable beds.

The cottage is non-smoking, pet friendly (for well-behaved animals) and we provide a fuel starter pack for the multi-fuel stove.

#####Lounge

The lounge is a cosy cottage living area, with south and west facing windows - perfect for catching the sun setting over the Atlantic Ocean! With comfortable seating, a TV, a docking station for your digital music and free Internet access it is the perfect spot to relax after a day of adventure. We supply a starter pack for the multi fuel stove, for the perfect end to a busy day exploring Harris the fire can be enjoyed with a relaxing dram, possibly from the nearby Isle of Harris Distillers. (Their whisky is still a few years off, but an Isle of Harris Gin is a tempting proposition.)

There is also a family dining table at the west facing window.
