#### Getting to the Outer Hebrides

<iframe class="float-right z-depth-2" {{ page.map }}></iframe>

The Google Map will help you plan your journey. [Directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Borve,+Isle+of+Harris,+Na+h-Eileanan+an+Iar+HS3,+UK/@57.840109,-7.011691,7z/data=!4m13!1m4!3m3!1s0x488d9fdcef1672e9:0xeaf481e50e2725e8!2sBorve,+Isle+of+Harris,+Na+h-Eileanan+an+Iar+HS3,+UK!3b1!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x488d9fdcef1672e9:0xeaf481e50e2725e8!2m2!1d-7.011691!2d57.840109?hl=en-GB "Google Map directions") can be found here for a variety of travel options. 

##### By Air

As well as daily direct flights from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen into Stornoway Airport, you can also fly into Benbecula or Barra and do some island hopping before you get here. Barra Airport has been voted one of the top 10 most beautiful airports in the world, taking the top spot in 2012, and heading for similar honours again in 2015. 

This up to date [flight information](http://www.visitouterhebrides.co.uk/visitor-info/getting-to-the-outer-hebrides/by-plane?p=1 "Flight Information") will help you decide the best route for you.

##### By Sea

Caledonian MacBrayne ferries connect the Outer Hebrides to the mainland and the islands to each other. Whether you plan to sail in to Stornoway or Tarbert to the north, or Leverburgh, which is only a few miles along the road from **The Croft House** the [CalMac website](https://www.calmac.co.uk/destinations/harris "Harris ferries") can help with all your planning and booking

##### Arriving on the Island

It is worth noting that depending whether you arrive via Tarbert, Leverburgh or Stornoway on a Saturday evening, a bit of forward planning may be needed.
Stornoway has a large [Co-op](http://www.co-operative.coop/find-us/?q=stornoway&lat=58.209435&long=-6.384869200000026&filters=Food&options=) and [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/store-locator/uk/?bID=5762) open until 10pm on Saturdays, allowing time to stock up on provisions even if you arrive on the last ferry or flight. However, if you arrive on the later ferries into Tarbert or Leverburgh you won't be able to do a grocery shopping until Moday without driving up to the supermarkets in Stornoway, almost an hour and a half away.


##### Travelling around the Outer Hebrides

Once you have arrived there are a number of ways to travel around.

Buses from Stornoway and Tarbert run past the cottage from Monday to Saturday. There is no Sunday bus service.
