##### Places to see
The Isle of Harris is full of contrasting scenery across the island. Mountains and moonscape landscapes in the north, give over to the rich machair and miles of stunning, golden sandy beaches of the south/west.

There is a nine-hole golf course at Scarista which has breathtakingly stunning views and golfers skills can be tested by the elements.

Whilst you are staying close to home, don't miss the Temple at Northton ... this area of Scotland is renowned for its Viking and Gaelic history, but places like [Rubh' an Teampaill](http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/outer-hebrides/rubh-an-teampaill.shtml) remind us that humans have inhabited this far flung corner for over 5000 years. A good excuse to pop in to the lovely [Temple Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/TheTempleCafe) too 

Leave plenty of time to make the trip up the west coast, as you’re sure to want to stop and walk some of the wonderful shell-sand beaches.  The most notable are Scarista, Borve, Nisabost, Seilebost, Horgabost and Luskentyre.

##### Tarbert
Tarbert is the main town in Harris. It has a few small shops, a tourist info office, bank and ferry terminal for ferries to and from Uig on the Isle of Skye and Lochmaddy on North Uist.

Harris Tweed is still woven by crofters here on the Isle of Harris, on traditional foot driven pedal looms and weaving demonstrations are available. In Tarbert, there’s a large Harris Tweed shop with plenty to interest those taking holidays in the Isle of Harris. A little way south is the Isle of Harris Knitwear Company, where you’ll find designer Harris Tweed products. Many of them are so individual that they can tell you the weaver.

##### Bays
You can drive round south Harris’s circular road in around three hours, but it is likely to take you longer, as you there will be frequent stops to take in the stunning land and seascapes. It’s really worth visiting the villages set amongst the rocky inlets of the Bays area of the east coast, such as Ardvey and Flodabay.  Then experience the deep contrast with Seilabost and Horgabost set among the sandy inlets and machair of the west coast.  Around the villages, you’ll find local cafes, art and craft galleries and other small enterprises with quality local products.

#####South
In the south of the Isle of Harris, near the small sheltered harbour of Rodel you can visit the ancient St. Clement’s church, where Clan Macleod chiefs worshipped since the 1500s. The [Rodel Hotel](http://www.rodelhotel.co.uk/index.html?pid=49) serves great food (local seafood) or stop in for a coffee or drink at the bar.

At the southern tip of the Isle of Harris lies the small ferry port of Leverburgh, where a ferry weaves its way, several times a day (including Sundays) around the reefs and shallow water of the Sound of Harris to the Island of Berneray inn North Uist. There is also a community owned co-operative shop that will service all your needs in the food and drink department.  Leverburgh has a hostel, post office, hairdressers, café, seafood restaurant & bar (The Anchorage), outdoor sports hire centre and gallery.

#####Further afield

To the north west of Tarbert, a winding 14 mile single track road reaches a magnificent conclusion at Hushinish, with a beautiful soft sand beach.  There are fantastic views to neighbouring islands, including Taransay and Scarp (the setting for the acclaimed feature film, The Rocket Post).  The road actually passes through the grounds of Amhuinnsuidhe Castle, built in 1865 for the 7th Earl of Dunmore.

Also a little way along this road is the most remote tennis court in Britain. In a beautiful setting overlooking the Atlantic ocean on the road to Hushinish, in North Harris, the new court at Bunabhainneadar offers a top class artificial grass surface and a cosy wooden pavilion (in case it rains and blows a hooly!).
